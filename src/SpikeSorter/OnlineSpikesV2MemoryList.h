/*
	Hacky X-macros to help make life much easier, but obfuscates compilation errors to near unparsability.
	Defining a new entry here will automatically populate class members in OnlineSpikesV2.h, populate code inOnlineSpikesV2::allocateMemory(),
	while also populating OnlineSpikesV2::~OnlineSpikesV2(). 
	
	If the amount of memory you want is dependent on a variable `foo`, one must have `foo` be defined as a member 
	of OnlineSpikesV2 prior to the allocateMemory() call performed in the constructor.

	TODO: Remove some now-unused entries from here.
